**ATTENTION: This fork of raylib is not the official version and in no means replacing it, its main purpose is to fix issues that are out of scope in the official raylib, mainly macOS related stuff, so be warned that I will close issues that I think should be reported [there](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/issues)**

**WARNING: Please, read this note carefully before submitting a new issue:**

It is important to realise that **this is NOT A SUPPORT FORUM**, this is for reproducible BUGS with raylib ONLY.

There are lots of generous and helpful people ready to help you out on [raylib Discord forum](https://discord.gg/raylib) or [raylib reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raylib/).

Remember that asking for support questions here actively takes developer time away from improving raylib.

Please, before submitting a new issue verify and check:

 - [ ] I tested it on latest raylib version from master branch
 - [ ] I checked there is no similar issue already reported
 - [ ] My code has no errors or misuse of raylib
 - [ ] The issue is related to this forks purpose (mainly macOS) and not a regular raylib issue
